Anonymous-mouse-server
===============

Part of a client and server system for anonymous chat services. 
Can connect to numerous services: Facebook, embedded zoho chat boxes and others planned.

An example settings.ini file is included in the resource folder. 
The settings.zip file is also included to show exmple configurations. It's password is 'thomas', the password is only there to stop casual snoopers. Use a program such as 7-zip to create a new passworded settings.zip containing all the same files. The rsakey.pem file should contain a pem formatted private key for the server.
In settings.ini:

The Facebook and zoho services should be filled in with the xmpp login details.
The 'inter_com' service can be any xmpp account, it acts as the back bone of the system and connects the clients to the server.

If you want to get involved and understand the system better then please have a look at technical.pdf
